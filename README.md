# UDYAM  
### Every effort deserves an opportunity

UDYAM is a voice-first, local-language AI career companion designed to help rural, semi-urban, and low-literacy users access jobs, skill development programs, and career guidance—simply by speaking in their own language.

It transforms effort into opportunity by guiding users from where they are today to where they want to work tomorrow.

## 🌾 Why UDYAM?

Across India, millions of people are willing to work, learn, and grow—but are held back by:
- Language barriers
- Low digital literacy
- Fragmented job information
- Lack of guidance when they are not immediately eligible
- Missed alerts for jobs, exams, and training programs

Most existing platforms are text-heavy and exclusionary.  
UDYAM is built on a different belief:

> **If someone is willing to put in effort, they deserve direction—not rejection.**

## 🚀 What UDYAM Does

- Enables users to **find nearby jobs or jobs in preferred cities** using voice
- Explains **job requirements, salary expectations, and eligibility** in simple language
- Identifies **skill gaps** and shows how to bridge them
- Recommends **free or low-cost government training programs and workshops**
- Provides **step-by-step guidance** for job applications
- Sends **proactive notifications** for:
  - Job opportunities  
  - Government exams  
  - Training programs  
  - Application deadlines  
- Works entirely through **voice-first interaction** in local and regional languages

## 🧠 What Makes UDYAM Different

- **Voice-First, Not Voice-Added**  
  Designed to work fully through speech, not as an add-on to text interfaces.

  Goes beyond job listings to show realistic career paths and next steps.

  Supports work near home as well as opportunities in nearby cities or desired urban locations.

  Prioritizes verified, free, or low-cost government skill programs.
